# Usage and Known Issues

The code is currently set up with the sinusoidal signals from section 2, since the vision half of the code is error-free. Unfortunately, there are issues with the kinematics that prevent it from functioning properly.
With these signals, the robot can sometimes hit the ground of the simulation or otherwise be thrown off after a long period of use, so it is recommended to restart gazebo frequently. For the elements of section 4 to function properly, the robot must be in its fresh initialised state to ensure the base joints are correctly identified (see report).
